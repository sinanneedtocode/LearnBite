<hr>
<h2><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>The <em>French Revolution (1789-1799)</em> was a period of <em>radical social and political change</em> in France that overthrew the <em>monarchy, established a republic, and introduced democratic ideals</em> like <strong>liberty, equality, and fraternity</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>2. Causes of the French Revolution</strong></h2>
<p>The revolution was caused by <em>political, social, economic, and intellectual factors</em>:</p>
<h3><strong>2.1 Political Causes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Absolute monarchy:</em> France was ruled by <strong>King Louis XVI</strong>, who was inefficient and weak. His extravagant spending led to a <strong>financial crisis</strong>.</li>
<li><em>Unfair taxation:</em> The <strong>Third Estate</strong> (common people) paid all the taxes, while the <strong>clergy</strong> and <strong>nobles</strong> were exempt.</li>
<li><em>No political representation:</em> The common people had <strong>no voice</strong> in governance.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2.2 Social Causes</strong></h3>
<p>French society was divided into <em>three estates</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>First Estate</strong> &ndash; <em>Clergy</em> (church officials) &ndash; <em>paid no taxes</em> and enjoyed privileges.</li>
<li><strong>Second Estate</strong> &ndash; <em>Nobility</em> &ndash; held high positions in government and <em>paid no taxes</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Third Estate</strong> &ndash; <em>Common people</em> (peasants, workers, middle class) &ndash; <em>paid heavy taxes</em> but had <em>no rights</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>2.3 Economic Causes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>France was in <em>huge debt</em> due to <em>wars and extravagant spending</em> (e.g., the <em>American Revolution</em>).</li>

<li>The <strong>Third Estate</strong> suffered <em>severe taxation</em> while the rich were exempt.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2.4 Intellectual Causes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Enlightenment thinkers like <em>John Locke, Montesquieu, and Rousseau</em> inspired ideas of <em>liberty, equality, and democracy</em>.</li>
